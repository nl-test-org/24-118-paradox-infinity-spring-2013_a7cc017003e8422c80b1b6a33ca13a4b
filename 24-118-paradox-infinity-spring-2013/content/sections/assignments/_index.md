Problem Sets
------------

*   There are 9 problem sets in all, but we will only take into account your 8 best scores.
*   It is okay to discuss problem sets with other students taking the class, and to consult published materials. But each student must complete the assignment on his or her own.
*   There were no problem sets for Weeks 1, 10, and 12.
*   The problem set for Week 4 appears courtesy of TA Owain R. Evans.
*   The problem sets count for 45% of the course grade.

End-of-Term Assignment
----------------------

The End-of-Term assignment will be posted during Week 13, and is due the following week.

Although individual consultation of published materials is okay, discussing the end-of-term assignment before the due date with anyone—whether or not they are taking the class—is strictly prohibited. All work on the assignment must be the student's own.

The End-of-Term assignment counts for 50% of the course grade.
